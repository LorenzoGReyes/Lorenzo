Fraud detection from dataset that comes from https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets as the link says the data is 
quite imbalanced, that means that only 1% percent of the transactions are frauds. 

Trying to find most of the frauds requires that our model has a high recall. In this notebook i try different models and different approaches to solving this
problem. 

I provide a yml file that i used for this project.
