# Hello

Got an 80% on the titanic challenge on Kaggle, will probably try harder soon.


Customer segementation is 200 obsevation data set where you clustering algorithms. 


Sales is some exploratory analysis and linear regression from a videogame sales database.


Netflix is just an exploratory data analysis for some netflix series and movies.

House prices was supposed to be an entry for a kaggle competition but i landed a job and i have to finish my master's thesis so i rushed the end of this project and i could've done a better job. Also, for this project i used R instead of python.
All data is from kaggle.
